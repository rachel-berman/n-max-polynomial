# n-max-polynomial
This code computes a combinatorial object I call "n-maximal polynomial". Given a finite field F and a positive integer n, this object is a polynomial over F of degree at most 2n  that has a maximal number of factorizations of a specific form. This work is motivated by an application to Rank-Metric Codes in the field of Coding Theory.
